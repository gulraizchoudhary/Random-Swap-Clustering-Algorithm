# Random-Swap-Clustering-Algorithm
Random swap is a kmeans variant that does not stuck in local optima and finds the optimal partitions by removing a random centroid and adding a random centroid. This strategy work pretty well. You just need to book keep the successful swaps where distortion value reduced further. 

## Usage

```python

SSE improvement over k-means: 6.31%
SSE improvement over k-means: 6.89%
SSE improvement over k-means: 5.23%
SSE improvement over k-means: 5.11%
SSE improvement over k-means: 5.42%
